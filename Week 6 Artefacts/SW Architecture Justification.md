# Architecture Justification for Music School Case Study
For the music school, the most applicable software architecture is a 3-tier web-based architecture. Some reasons why this architecture has been chosen have been outlined below.

1. The client (in this case a user of the system) will interact with the Music School system through their browser.
2. It requires no special software or hardware on the part of any user.
3. The Music School system performs all tasks on the web server, reducing the client's need to have a powerful computer to complete tasks.
4. The back-end interfaces with the database, so clients will not have the perception that the system they are interfacing with is as powerful in the background as it seems.
